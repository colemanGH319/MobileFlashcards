## Technologies

The application's UI was built with React Native. Other technologies include:

* Redux plus react-redux bindings for managing state.
* React Navigation for implementing the tab and stack navigation system
* Formik for relatively painless form creation

Additionally, the project was bootstrapped with [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)

## Installation

To install locally, clone the repository and run:

### `yarn install`

Then start the application with:

**Note**: In order to render the app on your device, you will have to install Expo via the App store (iOS) or the Google Play store (Android)

## Platforms

Currently, this application has only been developed and tested specifically for iOS. Android users may experience issues when running this software.
